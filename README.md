# Student Library Management System

Welcome to the **Student Library Management System**—a fully-featured web application built using **ASP.NET Core MVC** and **C# (.NET 8)**. This project was crafted using **Visual Studio 2022** and leverages **MS SQL Server 2020** as the backend database.

## Key Features

This system offers robust authentication and authorization, with two primary roles: **Admin** and **Student**.

### Student Role
- Students can **register** with their email and access the library's book catalog.
- They can view detailed information for each book, such as:
  - **Title**
  - **Author**
  - **Category**
  - **Shelf location** within the library
- Additionally, students can browse the list of all **book categories** and **student members**.

### Admin Role
- Admin users have full control over the system:
  - **Add new books** to the library database.
  - **Update or delete** existing book records.
  - **Download book lists** in **Microsoft Excel** format (using the **EPPlus** package).
  - Generate **PDF reports** of the book catalog (powered by **PdfSharpCore**).

## Technology Stack

This project is built using a modern and scalable technology stack, ensuring a seamless user experience and robust backend processing:

- **ASP.NET Core MVC** – For building a powerful and scalable web application.
- **Entity Framework Core** – For efficient and seamless interaction with **MS SQL Server**.
- **EPPlus** – For generating Excel reports ready for download.
- **PdfSharpCore** – For creating PDF reports of the book catalog.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap** – For a responsive and modern user interface.
- **GitHub** – Used for version control and collaborative development.
- **C# (OOP)** – Leveraging object-oriented principles for structured backend logic.

## Why This Project?

This project showcases expertise in full-stack web development using **.NET Core**, with a focus on real-world functionality such as user authentication, role-based access control, and document generation in multiple formats (Excel and PDF). It demonstrates proficiency in backend development with **Entity Framework Core** and database management using **MS SQL Server**, while also applying best practices in front-end design for an intuitive user experience.
